# Web App Example - Reading Tracker

This example demonstrates the CONTEXT.md workflow for a web application project.

## What This Example Shows

### CONTEXT.md Characteristics
- **Conversational tone**: Written as if thinking aloud or speaking
- **Personal motivation**: Includes the "why" behind the project
- **Exploratory thinking**: Shows decision-making process, not just decisions
- **Open questions**: Documents uncertainties and areas needing research
- **Timeline thoughts**: Includes realistic project planning
- **Success criteria**: Personal, not business-focused

### CLAUDE.md Characteristics
- **Structured format**: Clear sections for different types of information
- **Extracted requirements**: Distilled from conversational context
- **Technical specifications**: Organized, actionable
- **Implementation guidance**: Phase-based approach
- **Decision tracking**: Open questions documented
- **Context reference**: Points back to CONTEXT.md for deeper understanding

## Key Takeaways

1. **CONTEXT.md is where thinking happens** - It captures the messy, exploratory process of figuring out what to build and why

2. **CLAUDE.md is the refined output** - It takes that thinking and organizes it for effective agent collaboration

3. **Both stay connected** - CLAUDE.md references CONTEXT.md, acknowledging that the full context provides valuable depth

4. **Voice transcription style** - CONTEXT.md could easily have been captured via speech-to-text with minimal editing

## Usage Pattern

This example represents a common workflow:

1. **Brainstorm in CONTEXT.md** (voice or typing)
2. **Run `/context-to-claude`**
3. **Get structured CLAUDE.md** automatically
4. **Develop with Claude Code** using optimized context
5. **Add new ideas to CONTEXT.md** as project evolves
6. **Re-sync with `/add-to-context`** or `/context-to-claude`

## Try It Yourself

1. Copy this example to a new project
2. Modify CONTEXT.md with your own project ideas
3. Run `/context-to-claude` to see the transformation
4. Compare the generated CLAUDE.md with this example
