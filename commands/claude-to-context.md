description: Extract information from CLAUDE.md and incorporate into CONTEXT.md
---

This repository contains CLAUDE.md which provides structured instructions and context for Claude Code.

I would like to extract valuable information from CLAUDE.md and incorporate it into CONTEXT.md as supplementary contextual information. This is useful when CLAUDE.md contains details that should be preserved in the more detailed, narrative context file.

Execute these tasks in sequence:

## Task 1: Extract Relevant Information

Review CLAUDE.md and identify information that would be valuable to preserve in CONTEXT.md:
- Project requirements and specifications
- Implementation details and decisions
- Technical constraints or considerations
- Vision statements or project goals
- Background information about the project's purpose
- Any context that helps understand the "why" behind decisions

Focus on information that provides deeper understanding rather than purely procedural instructions.

## Task 2: Update CONTEXT.md

Add the extracted information to CONTEXT.md, integrating it naturally with existing content:

1. **Maintain the narrative style**: CONTEXT.md should remain conversational and human-friendly
2. **Organize logically**: Add clear section headers if introducing new topics
3. **Avoid duplication**: If similar information exists, merge thoughtfully rather than duplicate
4. **Preserve detail**: Don't summarize or condense - CONTEXT.md is meant to be comprehensive
5. **Add attribution**: Consider noting "Extracted from CLAUDE.md:" where appropriate

The goal is to enrich CONTEXT.md with valuable information from CLAUDE.md while maintaining its character as a human-friendly, detailed context repository.
