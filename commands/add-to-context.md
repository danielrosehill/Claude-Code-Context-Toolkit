description: Add new contextual information to the repository's context pool
---

I would like to add new contextual information to this repository.

The context data is gathered in CONTEXT.md (or in a context-data/ directory if chunked into multiple files).

I will provide new context that adds information to the context pool.

After I provide this information, execute these tasks in order:

## Task 1: Update the Context Pool

Add the new information to the appropriate location:

**If using CONTEXT.md:**
- Integrate the new information into CONTEXT.md
- Add appropriate section headers if introducing new topics
- Maintain the narrative, conversational style
- Ensure logical organization and flow
- Avoid duplication with existing content

**If using context-data/ directory:**
- Determine the most appropriate file based on topic/category
- Create a new file if the information represents a new category
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `user-requirements.md`, `technical-constraints.md`)
- Maintain consistent formatting across files

## Task 2: Update CLAUDE.md

Review and update CLAUDE.md to ensure it remains accurate and aligned with the expanded context:

1. **Check for new requirements**: If the new context introduces requirements, add them to CLAUDE.md
2. **Update project overview**: Reflect any changes to project scope or vision
3. **Add implementation guidance**: Include any new technical constraints or decisions
4. **Maintain consistency**: Ensure CLAUDE.md accurately reflects the expanded context pool

The goal is to keep both the human context (CONTEXT.md) and agent briefing (CLAUDE.md) synchronized and accurate.

## User Input Required

Please provide the new context you'd like to add. I'll handle the integration and updates.
