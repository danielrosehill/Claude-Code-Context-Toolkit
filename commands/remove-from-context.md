description: Remove outdated or incorrect information from the context pool
---

I would like to remove information from this repository's context pool.

The context data is stored in CONTEXT.md (or in a context-data/ directory if chunked).

I will specify what information should be removed.

After I provide this specification, execute these tasks in order:

## Task 1: Remove from Context Pool

Locate and remove the specified information:

**If using CONTEXT.md:**
- Find the section(s) containing the information to remove
- Delete the specified content
- Ensure remaining content flows naturally
- Adjust section headers if needed
- Preserve document structure and readability

**If using context-data/ directory:**
- Identify file(s) containing the information to remove
- Remove the specified content from relevant files
- Delete entire files if they become empty or irrelevant
- Ensure cross-references in other files remain valid

## Task 2: Update CLAUDE.md

Review and update CLAUDE.md to ensure it remains accurate after the removal:

1. **Remove obsolete information**: Delete any references to the removed context
2. **Update requirements**: Adjust project requirements if they were affected
3. **Revise guidance**: Update implementation guidance to reflect current context
4. **Check consistency**: Ensure CLAUDE.md is consistent with the updated context pool

## Task 3: Confirm Changes

Provide a summary of:
- What was removed from the context pool
- What changes were made to CLAUDE.md
- Whether any files were deleted (if using context-data/ directory)

## User Input Required

Please specify what information you'd like to remove from the context pool. You can:
- Describe the topic/content to remove
- Specify section names or file names
- Provide the actual text to remove
